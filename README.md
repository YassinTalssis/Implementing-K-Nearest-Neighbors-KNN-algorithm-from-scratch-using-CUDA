Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) involves leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to accelerate the computations. Below is a high-level outline of the steps involved in implementing KNN from scratch using CUDA:

    1-Dataset Preparation:
        +Load the dataset into CPU memory.
        +If necessary, preprocess the data (e.g., normalize, handle missing values, etc.).
        +Split the dataset into training and test sets.

    2-GPU Memory Allocation:
        +Allocate memory on the GPU for storing the dataset, training samples, and labels.

    3-Data Transfer:
        +Transfer the dataset, training samples, and labels from CPU memory to GPU memory.

    4-Distance Calculation (CUDA Kernel):
        +Implement a CUDA kernel function that calculates distances between the test samples and the training samples.
        +Each thread on the GPU will be responsible for calculating the distance between a single test sample and multiple training samples.
        +Utilize GPU parallelism to perform distance calculations efficiently.

    5-KNN Classification (CUDA Kernel):
        +Implement a CUDA kernel function that performs the KNN classification.
        +Each thread on the GPU will be responsible for finding the K nearest neighbors for a single test sample.
        +Utilize GPU parallelism to find the nearest neighbors efficiently.

    6-Results Transfer:
        +Transfer the classification results from GPU memory to CPU memory.

    7-Evaluation:
        +Compare the predicted labels with the true labels from the test set to evaluate the accuracy of the KNN model.
